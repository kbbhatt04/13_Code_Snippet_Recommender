# 13_Code_Snippet_Recommender
Code Snippet Recommender SSD Final Project

## Project Description
We have used the Python web development framework Flask for our project.
We have a simple UI which has two options on screen, one is to contribute by uploading a
code snippet, and the other one is search for code snippets serving a certain purpose.
The user clicks on the button corresponding to their requirement and then they are redirected
to another page accordingly.
If the user intends to upload a particular code snippet, the user is redirected to the sign‐up
page where the user either signs up or registers if they are a first time user.
After logging in, the user is redirected to a form.
The form asks the user for the language in which the code snippet is written, the keywords
describing the code snippet, and finally the snippet itself.

If the user wants to rate a particular snippet according to their experience and satisfaction,
the user will have to register if they are a new user or login if they are already a registered
user.
To search for code snippets, the user need not register or log in. They can simply search in the
search bar to view the desired snippets.
